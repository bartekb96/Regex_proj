    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
           "A particular route to a particular destination, under a
            particular policy (as reflected in the
            inetCidrRoutePolicy object).

            Dynamically created rows will survive an agent reboot.

            Implementers need to be aware that if the total number
            of elements (octets or sub-identifiers) in
            inetCidrRouteDest, inetCidrRoutePolicy, and
            inetCidrRouteNextHop exceeds 111, then OIDs of column
            instances in this table will have more than 128 sub-
            identifiers and cannot be accessed using SNMPv1,
            SNMPv2c, or SNMPv3."

inetCidrRouteDest OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX     InetAddress
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
           "The destination IP address of this route.

            The type of this address is determined by the value of
            the inetCidrRouteDestType object.

            The values for the index objects inetCidrRouteDest and
            inetCidrRoutePfxLen must be consistent.  When the value
            of inetCidrRouteDest (excluding the zone index, if one
            is present) is x, then the bitwise logical-AND
            of x with the value of the mask formed from the
            corresponding index object inetCidrRoutePfxLen MUST be
            equal to x.  If not, then the index pair is not
            consistent and an inconsistentName error must be
            returned on SET or CREATE requests."
